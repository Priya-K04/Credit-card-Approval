# Credit-card-Approval
Credit card approval is the process by which a financial institution evaluates an applicant's eligibility for a credit card. The approval decision is based on factors like credit score, income, and debt-to-income ratio. Approved applicants receive a credit card with a set limit and terms for usage.
